TO DO (ordered)
- Templated message construction, with default being ALI. Out of the box templates:
  - ALI (default)
  - ID only
  - ID - Summary
- Save the connection - do not disconnect, between check-ins. This is to have a faster check-in time in the case of multiple check-ins
- Offline mode: save ALM defects locally: only fetch the one which have changed
- Check QC/ALM version: must be 11 or later, with REST API support
- If domain/project/user/pass populated: auth and get the list immediately

DONE
- Default must work out of the box, and have ALI format
- Remove duplicates when changing the filter for the same project, or refreshin several times on the same project
- Warn if authentication is not over https as authentication is HTTP Basic
- Fix version update check
- Fix config file which is not read when modified by the user - move to registry
- Add target release to the list of fields retrieved
- Create 32bits installer
- Identify TurtleALM connections in ALM site admin by changing client-type
- Auto update by checking http://almtools.sourceforge.net/turtlealm-latest.txt
